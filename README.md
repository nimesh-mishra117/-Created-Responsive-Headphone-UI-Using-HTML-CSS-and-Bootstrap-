This project showcases a fully responsive UI for a headphone company profile 
website, utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to craft a modern and professional 
design. The website includes several key features: a top navigation bar with 
centered links and dropdown menus, a dynamic image carousel at the header, and 
dedicated sections for "About Us" and "Product" which include descriptive text 
and related multimedia content. The layout is designed to be visually appealing 
and user-friendly across various devices, ensuring a seamless viewing experience. 
This project serves as an excellent practice for students to understand and 
implement responsive web design techniques, Bootstrap components, and the 
integration of multimedia elements in a webpage.
